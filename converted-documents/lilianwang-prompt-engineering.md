Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to
communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model
weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot
among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.

This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing
with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt
engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable

text generation.

[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8
pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all

about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more

beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set

up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.

Basic Prompting

Zero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model,
pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.

Zero-Shot

Zero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.

(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)

Few-shot

Few-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both
input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can
better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted.
Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it
comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input
and output text are long.

Many studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance
and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the


<!-- Page 3 -->
examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near
SoTA.

Zhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several
biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1)
Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency
bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common
token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens.
To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by
the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A .

Tips for Example Selection

e Choose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using k-NN clustering in
the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)

e To select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a
graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph G = (V, EF) based on the
embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples,
where each node points to its k nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples

L = Q and a set of remaining samples U/. Each sample u € U is scored by

score(u) = s(v) where s(v) = p EcFl(vQeF}| p>
ve{v|(u,v)eE,vel}

such that s(v) is low if many of v's neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages

to pick diverse samples.

e Rubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one
training dataset for in-context learning sample selection. Given each training pair (a, y), the
quality of one example e; (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned
probability assigned by LM: score(e;) = Pym(y | e;, 2). We can identify other examples
with top-k and bottom-k scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every
training pair and use that for contrastive learning.

e Some researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)

e Motivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify
examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate

these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.

Tips for Example Ordering

e A general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test

sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.


<!-- Page 4 -->
e Increasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance
among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one
model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order
such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being
overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)

Instruction Prompting

The purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the
model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of
demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the
input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?

Instructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-
quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand
user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is
a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the
model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of

communication.

When interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details,
trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to
do.

Please label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review. The sentiment label sh
ould be "positive" or "negative".

Text: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.

Sentiment:

Explaining the desired audience is another smart way to give instructions

e For example to produce education materials for kids,

Describe what is quantum physics to a 6-year-old.

e And safe content,

. in language that is safe for work.

In-context instruction learning (Ye et al. 2023) combines few-shot learning with instruction
prompting. It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the

prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their


<!-- Page 5 -->
experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label

options.

Definition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, "agent" or "customer".
Input: I have successfully booked your tickets.
Ouput: agent

Definition: Determine which category the question asks for, "Quantity" or "Location".
Input: What's the oldest building in US?
Ouput: Location

Definition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, “positive” or “negative”.
Input: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.
Output:

Self-Consistency Sampling

Self-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature
> 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates. The criteria for selecting the best
candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that
are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run

through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences
to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to
eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated
reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks

only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.

Types of CoT prompts

Two main types of CoT prompting:

e Few-shot CoT. It is to prompt the model with a few demonstrations, each containing
manually written (or model-generated) high-quality reasoning chains.

(All the math reasoning examples are from GSM8k)

Question: Tom and Elizabeth have a competition to climb a hill. Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to
climb the hill. Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill. How many hou
rs does it take Tom to climb up the hill?

Answer: It takes Tom 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>12@ minutes to climb the hill.


<!-- Page 6 -->
It takes Tom 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours to climb the hill.
So the answer is 2.

Question: Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer sho
es. Each pair of socks cost $9.5@, and the shoes cost $92. Jack has $4@. How much more money d
oes Jack need?

Answer: The total cost of two pairs of socks is $9.50 x 2 = $<<9.5*2=19>>19.

The total cost of the socks and the shoes is $19 + $92 = $<<19+92=111>>111.

Jack need $111 - $40 = $<<111-40=71>>71 more.

So the answer is 71.

Question: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the

cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?
Answer:

e Zero-shot CoT. Use natural language statement like Let's think step by step to explicitly
encourage the model to first generate reasoning chains and then to prompt with
Therefore, the answer is to produce answers (Kojima et al. 2022 ). Or a similar statement

Let's work this out it a step by step to be sure we have the right answer (Zhou et al.
2022).

Question: Marty has 10@ centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the
cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?
Answer: Let's think step by step.

Tips and Extensions

e Self-consistency sampling can improve reasoning accuracy by sampling a number of diverse
answers and then taking the majority vote. (Wang et al. 2022a)

e Another approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model
generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during
multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final
answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)

e If training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales,
we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to
generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-
tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note
that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers.
If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes

as the “correct” answers.

e Prompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better
performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains.
When separating reasoning steps, newline \n symbol works better than step i , period

orsemicolon ; . (Fu etal. 2023)


<!-- Page 7 -->
Complexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the

generations by taking majority vote among only top k complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)

Later, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex
examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple
questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.

Changing Q: tO Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)

Ye & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small
to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects
vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be
inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely

lead to incorrect predictions.

Self-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up
questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered
by search engine results. Similarly, /RCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and
ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to
Wikipedia APls to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the

context.


<!-- Page 8 -->
Question: Who lived longer, Theodor Haecker or Harry Vaughan
Watkins?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.

Follow up: How old was Theodor Haecker when he died?
Intermediate answer: Theodor Haecker was 65 years old when he
died.

Follow up: How old was Harry Vaughan Watkins when he died?
Intermediate answer: Harry Vaughan Watkins was 69 years old when
he died.

So the final answer is: Harry Vaughan Watkins.

Question: In what year was the current tallest wooden lattice tower
completed?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.

Follow up: What is the current tallest wooden lattice tower?

Query: What is the current tallest wooden lattice tower?
Search

Engine }/Response: Radio Tower Gliwice

Intermediate answer: Radio Tower Gliwice.
Follow up: When was Gliwice Radio Tower completed?

Query: When was Gliwice Radio Tower completed?
Search

Engine }/Response: 1935

Intermediate answer: 1935.
So the final answer is: 1935.

e Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities
at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates
multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be

BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.

Automatic Prompt Design

Prompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting desired output
given input. Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly
on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-
Tuning (Li & Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021).
This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them.

The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.

APE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of
model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a

chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.

1. Prompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in
the form of input-output pairs. E.g. {{Given desired input-output pairs}}\n\nThe instruction
is .

2. Given a dataset of Dirain = {(z, y) }, we would like to find an instruction p such that
p* = arg maxy Ee y)cDuain lf (PL, y)], where f(.) is a per-sample score function, such as
execution accuracy 1/LM(. |p, 2) = y] or log probability: pp (y | p, x).

3. Use an iterative Monte Carlo search method to improve the best candidates by proposing
semantically similar variants via prompts like Generate a variation of the following

instruction while keeping the semantic meaning.\n\nInput: ...\n\nOutput:...


<!-- Page 10 -->
To construct chain-of-thought prompts automatically, Shum et al. (2023) suggested augment-
prune-select, a three-step process:

1. Augment: Generate multiple pseudo-chains of thought given question using few-shot or
zero-shot CoT prompts;

2. Prune: Prune pseudo chains based on whether generated answers match ground truths.

3. Select: Apply a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to learn the probability distribution
over selected examples, while considering the probability distribution over examples as
policy and the validation set accuracy as reward.

Zhang et al. (2023) instead adopted clustering techniques to sample questions and then
generates chains. They observed that LLMs tend to make certain types of mistakes. One type of
errors can be similar in the emebedding space and thus get grouped together. By only
sampling one or a few from frequent-error clusters, we can prevent too many wrong
demonstrations of one error type and collect a diverse set of examples.

1. Question clustering: Embed questions and run k-means for clustering.

2. Demonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one
demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the

cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.

3. Rationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions
and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.

Augmented Language Models

A survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over
multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of
using external tools. Recommend it.

Retrieval

Often we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining
time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the
context if we don't explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain
Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then
incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process
depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.

Lazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment
LLMs. Given a question gq, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting
in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into


<!-- Page 11 -->
paragraphs of 6 sentences, {p}. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity
between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the
prompt to produce an answer a.

For closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot
prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and

answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.

Evidence: ...
Question: ...
Answer: ...

The answer probability is computed in three ways:

1. RAG style, p(a; | q) = S071 Peeiae(D: | @) - PLai(a: | @, Pi), where pisiar(p: | g) is the
normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.

pum (9|@i,Pi)-Pum (ilps)

2. Noisy channel inference, p(a; | q) = pi (q\pi)

3. Product-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to pr(p; | q).

According to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer
reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, ppr(a | g, D;)
and pim(q | pi, a) are found to be most informative. pum (q | pi, a) captures how well the
question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be

used for reranking answer candidates.

One observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that
despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search,
its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This
suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual
information and model internal knowledge.

Interestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate
knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use the
following template to extract knowledge:

Generate some knowledge about the input. Examples:

Input: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?
Knowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.

Input: {question}
Knowledge:

And then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.


<!-- Page 12 -->
Programming Language

Both PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts
prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to
resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime
such as a Python interpreter. Such setup decouples complex computation and reasoning. It

relies on a LM with good enough coding skills.

Question: In Fibonacci sequence, it follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

Assuming the first two numbers are 0 and 1, what is the 50th number in Fibonacci sequence?

length_of_fibonacci_sequence = 50
The first number is 0, the second number is 1, therefore, the _| |fibonacci_sequence = np.zeros(length_of_)
third number is 0+1=1. The fourth number is 1+1=2. The fifth | 'fibonacci_sequence[0] = 0

number is 1+2=3. The sixth number is 2+3=5. The seventh fibonacci_sequence[1] = 1
number is 3+5=8. The eighth number is 5+8=13. For i in range(8, length_of_fibonacci_sequence):

External APIs

TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented
with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text
conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the
specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The

final output is generated following |output token.

An abstract task:
task input text |fool-call tool input text |result tool out-
put text |output task output text

A weather task:

how hot will it get in NYC today? |weather lookup re-
gion=NYC |result precipitation chance: 10, high temp:
20c, low-temp: 12c |output today’s high will be 20C

Figure 4: The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).

TALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and
finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively
expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs.

Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely


<!-- Page 13 -->
mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a

binary reward signal.

Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is
built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API.
The toolbox of Toolformer includes:

e Calculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;

© Q&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;

Search engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;

Translation system to improve performance on low resource language;

Calendar to make LM be aware of time progression.

(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).

Toolformer is trained as follows:

1. Prompting to annotate potential API calls. Ask a pre-trained LM to annotate a dataset via
few-shot learning with API call usage examples. Formatting example:

legislative bodies.] that requires legislative bodies, like
city councils, to hold their meetings open to the public.

Figure 7: How dataset is annotated to do API calls.

(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).

- Each API call is represented as a tuple of (API name, corresponding input), $c=(a_c, i_c)$ a

nd its corresponding result is denoted as $r$. The API call sequences with and without results

are labeled as follows, respectively:

<div>
$$
\begin{aligned}

e(c) & \langle\texttt{API}\rangle a_c(i_c) \langle\texttt{/API}\rangle \\
e(c, r) & \langle\texttt{API}\rangle a_c(i_c) \to r \langle\texttt{/API}\rangle

\end{aligned}
$$

</div>

- Sample API calls based on the probabilities $p \text{LM}(\langle\texttt{API}\rangle \mid \te
xt{prompt}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x}_{1:i})$ and select top $k$ candidate positions for doing AP

I calls at position $i$ if the probability is larger than a threshold.

- Then we sample potential API calls from the LM given the sequence $[\text{prompt}(\mathbf
{x}), x_1, \dots, x_{i-1}, \langle\texttt{API}\rangle]$ as prefix and $\langle\texttt{/API}\ra

ngle$ as suffix.

2. Filter annotations based on whether API calls help model predict future tokens. Use a self-

supervised loss to decide which API calls are actually helpful.

o Execute each API call c; to get corresponding result 7;.

© Compute weighted cross entropy loss for the LM over tokens z;,. .

is prefixed with the prompt. Two versions are computed, one with API result and the

other with empty sequence e.

a

L. = min(L;(e), Li(e(ci, é)))

a

Only API calls with L; — Ly larger than a threshold are kept, meaning that adding this
API call and its results help the model predict future tokens.

3. Fine-tune LM on this annotated dataset. The new training sequences are constructed as
x* = £141, €(Ci, Ti), Lien - The training data is a combination of the original dataset (e.g. a

subset of CCNet, as in the paper) and its augmented version.

At inference time, decoding runs until the model produces “— " token, indicating that it is
expecting response from an API call next.

Toolformer currently does not support tool use in a chain (i.e. using the output of one tool as
an input for another tool) or in an interactive way (i.e. adopt API response after human

selection). Both are interesting future directions to expand the model for.
