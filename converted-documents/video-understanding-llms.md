Over the past decade, neutrino astronomy has emerged as a new window into the extreme and
hiddenuniverse. Current-generationexperimentshavedetectedhigh-energyneutrinosofastrophysical
origin and identified the first sources, opening the field to discovery. Looking ahead, the authors of
this Perspective identify seven major open questions in neutrino astrophysics and particle physics
that could lead to transformative discoveries over the next 20 years. These multidisciplinary
questions range from understanding the vicinity of a black hole to unveiling the nature of neutrino
mass, among other topics. Additionally, we critically review the current experimental capabilities
and their limitations and, from there, discuss the interplay between different proposed neutrino
telescopetechnologiesandanalysistechniques. Theauthorsfirmlybelievethatachievingtheimmense
discoverypotentialoverthenexttwodecadesdemandsamodelofglobalpartnershipandspecialized,
complementary detectors. This collaborative neutrino telescope network will pave the way for a
thriving multimessenger era, transforming our understanding of neutrino physics, astrophysics, and
the extreme universe.

at the same time can make event classification challenging. Furthermore, classifying events as “signal”
or “background” is a statistical process. It is usually
not possible to definitively distinguish each event as

be made based on the event’s characteristics. This
can be as simple as using the particle’s estimated
energy as a characteristic to cut on, as it accounts
for the fact that atmospheric components have a
softer spectrum, or filtering for Earth-penetrating
events to reduce muon rates. More sophisticated
techniques are also used, such as veto-based event selections,whichaimtokeeponlyeventswithneutrino
interaction vertices contained within the detector,
and event selections targeting unique interactions or
flavors, such as showers, identifiable tau events, or
Glashow events, as discussed in Section IIA. Generally, a combination of many techniques leads to a
final analysis-ready event sample.

while higher in signal-to-noise ratio, become statistically limiting in astrophysical neutrinos. Either they
are still background dominated or become extremely
