ABSTRACT GitHub Copilot is transforming software development by automating tasks and boosting
productivity through AI driven code generation. In this paper, we conduct a literature survey to synthesize
insights on Copilot's impact on productivity and security. We review academic journal databases, industry
reports, and official documentation to highlight key findings and challenges. While Copilot accelerates
coding and prototyping, concerns over security vulnerabilities and intellectual property risks persist. Drawing
from the literature, we provide a perspective on best practices and future directions for responsible AI
adoption in software engineering, offering actionable insights for developers and organizations to integrate
Copilot effectively while maintaining high standards of quality and security.

## Tables

**Table (Page 2):**

| Pull Request Summaries | AI generated summaries of pull request changes, emphasizing affected files and critical areas for review (Copilot Enterprise only). |
|---|---|
| Text Completion (Beta) | AI powered text completion to quickly and accurately generate pull request descriptions (Copilot Enterprise only). |
| Knowledge Bases | Create and maintain documentation sets to serve as contextual references for conversations with GitHub Copilot. When using Copilot Chat on GitHub.com or in Visual Studio Code, you can select a specific knowledge base to improve the relevance and accuracy of Copilot’s responses to your queries. |


**Table (Page 2):**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Code Completion | GitHub Copilot provides auto complete style suggestions in supported IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Azure Data Studio, Vim/Neovim). Users can select standard commands like /fix (fix the problem in code), /explain (offer detailed explanations of code), /doc (generate documentation for code), and /tests (create tests for the code) for a selected portion of text. Alternatively, users can enter a query to receive tailored suggestions, enabling real time code improvements based on AI driven insights. |
| Copilot Chat | GitHub Copilot provides a chat interface for coding related questions. Users can select standard commands such as /fix, /explain, /doc, or /tests for a selected portion of text. Alternatively, users can enter custom queries to receive Copilot’s context aware suggestions and solutions in real time. Users can check log errors, create feature flags, and deploy apps to the cloud (Public Beta). Additional features include "pull request difference analysis," a web search powered by Bing (Public Beta), and the ability to inquire about failed Actions jobs (Public Beta). Users can also obtain answers regarding issues, pull requests, discussions, files, commits, and more [2]. |
| Copilot in the CLI | A chat like interface in the terminal that provides command suggestions or explanations. |


**Table (Page 3):**

| Use case | Description |
|---|---|
| Routine Task Automation | Experienced developers benefit from Copilot by automating repetitive tasks, allowing more time for complex work. Senior developers often manage multiple projects and find that tools like Copilot save time on routine tasks such as writing unit tests or database queries. |
| Learning and Skill Development | Junior developers benefit from Copilot as an interactive tutor, helping them quickly learn unfamiliar programming languages, frameworks, or libraries. By suggesting optimized code and providing immediate feedback, Copilot enhances their coding skills and boosts their confidence. The 'Explain this' feature of Copilot helps junior developers break down and understand complex logic or algorithms easily. |
| Code Refactoring | Copilot greatly assists developers in cleaning up legacy codebases by identifying redundancies and recommending reusable code blocks. This enhances code readability and maintainability, ultimately accelerating future development efforts. |
| Code Review | Developers can benefit from GitHub Copilot during code reviews by receiving recommendations that help maintain high standards of quality and consistency. Copilot's pull request (PR) feature streamlines this process by automatically generating summaries of changes and highlighting key areas that need attention. This allows teams to stay productive while ensuring that quality is not sacrificed, resulting in a more efficient and detailed review process. |
| Test-Driven Development (TDD) | Developers benefit from Copilot by supporting TDD practices in the generation of test cases. This enables them to implement TDD seamlessly and efficiently in the early stages of development, ensuring higher code quality from the outset. |
