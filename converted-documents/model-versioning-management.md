We especially define two self-evaluation protocols (PT-

### NN and PT-GG) to observe the performance of detectors

which is trained on the past and tested on the future: i)
train on NeRF-rendered images and test on unseen NeRF-
rendered images, ii) train on 3DGS-rendered images and
testonunseen3DGS-renderedimages. ForPT-NNandPT-
GG,thelistofevaluationsisprovidedintheTab.V.

### PT-NN: To train the detectors, we select the images from

the methods of real, I, II, III, IV, and V, excluding those
from folders designated for evaluation, which are summarized in the list of evaluation. To evaluate the performanceofthedetectors,weutilizeallimagesfromthemethods of real, I, II, III, IV, and V located within the folders in the following list that is specified for evaluation:
nerfstudio/{bww-entrance, campanile, desolation, Egypt,
kitchen,library,person,redwoods2,storefront,stump,vegetation}, record3d/bear, head/face, eyefultower/{office1b,
office-view2,riverview},mip360/{bicycle,bonsai,counter,
flowers,kitchen,room,stump,treehill}.
PT-GG To train the detectors, we select the 1,786, 1,721,
1,234, 1,721 images from the L, M, N, O datasets for the
methods of real, VI, VII, and VIII. To evaluate the performance of the detectors, we use the images from the K
